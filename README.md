# Computational-microbiology-of-soil-Use-of-the-concept-of-curve-skeleton
Computational microbiology of soil organic matter mineralization: Use of the concept of curve skeleton to partition the 3D pore space in computed tomography images.
The programs and the data are used for the implementation and the validation of our method for the submitted paper in PLOS Computational biology.
We first use the curve skeleton to partitionnate the 3D pore space and then we simulate the organic matter mineralization.
You need to have MATLAB and PYTHON in order to test our approach.
The used datasets cannot be uploaded directly to github that why they were uploaded separately in another platform.
